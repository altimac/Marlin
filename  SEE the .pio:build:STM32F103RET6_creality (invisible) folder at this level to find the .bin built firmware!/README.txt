Once built using VSCode (using the great) "Marlin Firmware Auto Build" VSCode plugin, the firmware (.bin file) will be located at: (~/Developpement/Marlin)/.pio/build/STM32F103RET6_creality/firmware-20211006-191306.bin
On macOS the .pio directory is invisible in the Finder... that does not help :)

Remember that the firmware .bin file must have a different file name after *each* upgrade. Typically use the real date-time as a postfix...
